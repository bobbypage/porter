Hi! I'm David Porter.

I'm currently a software engineer at Google. I work on [Google Kubernetes
Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine).

I graduated from University of Washington's [Computer
Science](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) program in 2019. I interned at a few
companies during school including Facebook & Microsoft.

I made some [iOS
apps](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/draw-it-for-ipad/id366755447) back in the
day.

I grew up and live in Seattle.
